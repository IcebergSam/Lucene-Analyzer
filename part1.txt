Basic Indexing2. Indices are divided into shards when the size of the index is exceeds the space available to it. 3. Indices are replicated as a fault tolerance mechanism. 4. Yellow cluster health indicates that all data is available and the cluster is fully functional, however the replicas are not yet allocated since the cluster consisted of a single running node when the command was given. Indexing Reddit1. Command used to very empty indices: curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&pretty" where the response is only the header (no data rows)2. Name of index created: comments3. pri.store.size = 32.4 mbSearch1. The three queries return different sets of documents as evidenced by the _id identifiers in each query2. Q1 max_score=10.503806 ; Q2 max_score=11.629242 ; Q3 max_score=18.844023. Elasticsearch does not stem any words by default.4. curl -XGET "localhost:9200/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d"{ \"query\": { \"match\" : { \"body\" : { \"query\" : \"a\"} } } }"Analyzers1. Command used to delete all indices: curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/comments?pretty&pretty"1. The three commands this time return the same set of documents for each query, and the first two queries return identical reults due to the stemming of "cat"/"cats". The third query resulted in a significantly higher max score than when it was used without the analyzer. All three queries returned the same number of hits using the analyzer, while the three queries used without the analyzer returned fewer and varying total hits in comparison. 2. The size of the index has become smaller (24.2mb with analyzer compared to 32.4mb on previous runs) since stemming is more likely to shorten suffixes or words than to lengthen them.
